# ReBASE project 

Imagine a severe weather event occurs, causing devastating impacts to a particular region. ReBASE will provide answers to key questions about how the consequences of such extreme weather events have already changed and how those consequences may change further in future.

ReBASE is a new methodology which will allow anyone to answer questions about the severity of extreme weather events in their own chosen region, anywhere in the globe. For example, how have the consequences of a particular weather situation been made worse by climate change? If the same weather situation had occurred in the climate that we had 100 years ago, would it have been less damaging? What about if the weather situation happens again in the future? 

### Time periods being considered

Our first targeted time periods are:

**1909-1911** - known extreme floods and heatwaves across Europe. Wildfire in the US.

**1975-1976** - extreme heat and drought in the UK. Windstorm. Flood in China.

**2015-2024** - every extreme event globally could be analysed

### People involved
