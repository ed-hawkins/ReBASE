**ReBASE project** 

Imagine a severe weather event occurs, causing devastating impacts to a particular region. This project will provide answers to key questions about how the consequences of such extreme weather events have already changed and how those consequences may change further in future.

ReBASE is a new methodology to answer questions about the severity of extreme weather events – how have the consequences of a particular weather situation been made worse by climate change? If the same weather situation had occurred in the climate that we had 100 years ago, would it have been less damaging? What about if the weather situation happens again in the future? As an example, we might expect that more rain would fall today in a severe storm than if the same storm had occurred 100 years ago, potentially making the consequences worse. But, how much more rain? 

This project will consider many different types of extreme weather event, including heavy rainfall, windstorms, heatwaves and droughts, and examine the consequences of those weather events for society, including damage to property and flooding. Importantly, we will identify the additional impacts of a particular weather event which are due to living in a warmer world, directly addressing the critical issue of losses and damages caused by climate change. We will also build narratives of plausible worst-case events to inform decision making on adapting to our warming world.
